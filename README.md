# 👋 Hi, I'm Shresth Khaitan  

I am an aspiring computer scientist interested in **machine learning**, **distributed systems**, and **security-focused AI**.  
My work bridges **representation learning**, **multi-objective optimization**, and **systems engineering** to build models that remain reliable and deployable under real-world constraints.

Below is a selection of my research and academic projects.

## 🔬 Research Projects

### **AE-CNN Ensemble — Network Intrusion Detection**
**Python • PyTorch • Machine Learning • CNN + Autoencoder**  
A hybrid architecture for intrusion detection combining an autoencoder, 1D-CNN, and soft-voting ensemble.  
- Built complete training and evaluation pipelines on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017.  
- Conducted ablations, statistical tests, and dataset balancing strategies for robust evaluation.  
- Manuscript under review at *IEEE Access*.

### **FAS-MOEA — Multi-Objective Recommendation Framework**  
**Python • PyTorch • NSGA-II • Optimization**  
A recommendation system that jointly optimizes fairness, accuracy, and serendipity using NSGA-II.  
- Designed domain-specific objective functions and Pareto-front evaluation metrics.  
- Parallelized evolutionary operations for scalable runtime on MovieLens and Amazon datasets.  
- Achieved improvements across F1-score, fairness, and serendipity metrics.

## 🧠 Academic Projects

### **CareerWise — AI-Based Career Guidance Platform**  
**Python • Flask • ML Pipelines • Caching**  
A low-latency career recommendation system using aptitude inputs and academic histories.  
- Implemented session-aware personalization and optimized caching for fast response times.  
- Designed an end-to-end prototype exploring system-level constraints and user modeling.

### **Bengaluru Multi-Camera Traffic Analysis & Prediction**  
**Python • OpenCV • YOLO • Tracking Pipelines**  
A computer vision system for city-scale traffic monitoring.  
- Built multi-camera vehicle detection, classification, and deduplication logic.  
- Designed direction and flow estimation functions for near–real-time inference.

### **Decentralized Zero-Knowledge Password Manager**  
**Cryptography • Distributed Storage • Python**  
A secure password manager designed without a central point of failure.  
- Implemented client-side encryption and tamper-evident logs.  
- Added recovery using Shamir’s Secret Sharing and fault-tolerant storage semantics.

### **ForensicNett — Cyberbullying Detection & Forensic Evaluation**  
**NLP • Explainability • Python**  
A system for detecting coordinated abuse on social platforms.  
- Introduced a forensic evaluation metric penalizing errors based on operational impact.  
- Developed a lightweight classification pipeline and analysis tools.
