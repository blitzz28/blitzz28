# 👋 Hi, I'm Shresth Khaitan  

I am an aspiring computer scientist interested in **machine learning**, **distributed systems**, and **security-focused AI**.  
My work bridges **representation learning**, **multi-objective optimization**, and **systems engineering** to build models that remain reliable and deployable under real-world constraints. 

My long-term goal is to develop AI systems that remain robust under distribution shift and real-world constraints.
